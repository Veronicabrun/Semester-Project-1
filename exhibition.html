            <hr class="line-exhibition">
            <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Wheredo we come from and how did we get here? 
              Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world</p>
            <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time.</p>
            <p>You canalso take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number 
              of dinosaurs too.</p>

            <hr class="line-exhibition">
            <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how 
              to create a sustainable future not justfor humans but for the whole planet.</p>
            <p>In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming, extinction of species, 
                and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future</p>
            <p>Learn more about what you can do for and contribute to a more environmentally friendly planet for our next generation.</p>
